# Flipped B drive?

It means mounting the motor on the upper side of the gantry.

Pros: The belt is closer to the motor body so there's less bending torque on the motor shaft.

Cons: Depending on how you mount the umbilical wires / cable gland, the B motor might collide to the back of the toolhead when homing.
One way to get around it is to home X axis before homing Y. There should be enough over-travel so it won't collide in the print area.
